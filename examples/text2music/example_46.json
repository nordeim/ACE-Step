    "caption": "An energetic indie rock track driven by a clean, catchy electric guitar riff and a punchy, straightforward drum and bass groove. The male lead vocal is clear and powerful, delivering an anthemic melody that soars during the high-energy chorus. The arrangement follows a classic verse-chorus structure, punctuated by a brief, melodic guitar break and a dynamic bridge that builds back into a final, powerful chorus before concluding with the initial guitar riff.",
    "lyrics": "[Intro - Guitar Riff]\n\n[Verse 1]\nWoke up in the electric city, bright light\nNeon signs and shadows we ignite\nStepping to the beat, feel the heart race\nLife's a wild ride in this endless place\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSynths and bass, they carry us above\nFunk rhythms mixed with electric love\nDrums pounding loud in the crowded street\nGuitar strings strum to our moving feet\n\n[Chorus]\nTurn it up, feel the electric heartbeat\nEvery pulse bringing us to our feet\nDance through the night, we're invincible\nElectric heartbeat, unstoppable\n\n[Instrumental Break - Guitar Riff]\n\n[Verse 2]\nCity lights flicker in a rhythmic trance\nUnder moon's glow, we take a chance\nVoices harmonize in a primal scream\nEvery note a spark, fueling our dream\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nFeel the rush, let it take control\nElectric fire burning in our soul\nNo turning back, we're lost in the sound\nIn this moment, forever unbound\n\n[Chorus]\nTurn it up, feel the electric heartbeat\nEvery pulse bringing us to our feet\nDance through the night, we're invincible\nElectric heartbeat, unstoppable\n\n[Outro - Guitar Riff and Drums]\n[abrupt silence]",
