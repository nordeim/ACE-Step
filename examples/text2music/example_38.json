    "caption": "A driving post-punk arrangement kicks off with layered electric guitars—one clean and arpeggiated, the other providing distorted chordal texture—over a solid bassline and powerful live drums. The male lead vocal is delivered with an angsty, strained quality that builds into an anthemic, shouted chorus where his voice cracks with emotion. Following a melodic yet noisy guitar solo filled with feedback and expressive bends, the track breaks down to its core rhythmic elements before fading out on lingering guitar noise.",
    "lyrics": "[Intro - Arpeggiated Electric Guitar]\n\n[Verse 1]\nUnder neon lights, they flicker and fade\nLost in the hum of this restless parade\nA city's heartbeat pulses in my veins\nSearching for answers in the acid rain\nShadows stretch long, they're clawing my way\nThe night is alive but it's mine to obey\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, shadows of neon\nWhere do you run?\nBleeding out the night just to make us one\nOh, shadows of neon\nTell me the truth\nAre you the ghost or the one I chase with you?\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe walls are whispering secrets they can't keep\nEchoes of footsteps buried six feet deep\nEvery corner's a story you'll never forget\nI'm tangled in chaos, dressed up as regret\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, shadows of neon\nWhere do you run?\nBleeding out the night just to make us one\nOh, shadows of neon\nTell me the truth\nAre you the ghost or the one I chase with you?\n\n[Outro - Extended Guitar Solo]\n[Music fades out]",
