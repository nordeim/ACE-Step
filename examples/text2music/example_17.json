    "caption": "A melancholic piano melody opens over atmospheric pads, setting an introspective tone before a crisp lo-fi hip-hop beat enters with a deep sub-bass foundation. The lead male vocal is smooth and emotive, delivered with significant reverb that enhances its spacious quality. The arrangement builds dynamically into a powerful chorus where layered vocals soar over swelling synth strings and intensified drums. A brief bridge offers a moment of reflection with more sparse instrumentation before launching back into a climactic final chorus featuring passionate ad-libs and harmonies. The track concludes with fading ambient textures and lingering piano notes.",
    "lyrics": "[Intro: Piano Arpeggio]\n\n[Verse 1]\nFootsteps echo in the quiet night\nA lamp flicker, casting cold light\nShadows stretch long on the pavement below\nWhat they say, I don't know\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhispers in the misty air\nA promise made, left somewhere\nWhoa\n\n[Chorus]\nI've got dreams that fade, but they stay\nLost in the glow of yesterday\nWhoa\nI'm chasing shadows in the rain\nBut every step feels the same\n\n[Verse 2]\nNeon signs hum their lonesome tune\nThe sky painted dark, a fading moon\nWindows fogged with stories untold\nThis city's heart is icy cold\n(Ooooh)\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nEvery corner hides a piece of me\nA ghost of who I used to be\nOh\n\n[Chorus]\nI've got dreams that fade, but they stay\nLost in the glow of yesterday\nWhoa\nI'm chasing shadows in the rain\nBut every step feels the same\n\n[Outro]\n[Piano arpeggio fades out]",
