    "caption": "A classic boom-bap hip-hop track built on a nostalgic foundation. A steady drum machine groove with a crisp snare drives the song forward beneath atmospheric synth pads that create an introspective mood. The male rapper delivers confident verses with a clear flow, while the chorus shifts to melodic, layered vocal harmonies soaked in reverb for an anthemic feel. The arrangement is punctuated by spoken ad-libs treated with echo effects and concludes with an extended outro featuring heavily filtered vocals over a stripped-back beat before fading into ambient textures.",
    "lyrics": "[Intro]\nYo\nIt's Laðum\nYou already know\nMoney talks\nThey don't talk back\n\n[Verse 1]\nI stay with the heat, streets raised me\nNever folded under pressure, now I'm way crazy\nChains on my neck, still my grind daily\nBut my soul stay heavy, yeah the grind ain't lazy\nOld heads stackin', but I flip through the beat\nStackin' chips on chips, now they movin' in the street\nBut the streets ain't ready, now my path got heat\nUsed to dream to win, now I move with the beat\nCopped a cold brick, got heat in my heart\nNow my chain swing tight, I been playin' my part\nMoney ain't a thing, but it takes its part\nStill I carry my soul like it's built from the start\n\n[Chorus]\nSo tell me, why they hate when you live?\nGot the heart of a king, but the soul in the bills\nTell me, who the heck do they feel?\nWhen the world keep spinnin' but you lost it all still\n(Still, still, still)\nWhy they hate when you live?\nWith the heart of a king, but the soul in the bills\nTell me, who the heck do they feel?\nWhen the world keep spinnin' but you lost it all still\n(Still, still, still)\nWhy they hate when you live?\nWith the heart of a king, but the soul in the bills\nTell me, who the heck do they feel?\nWhen the world keep spinnin' but you lost it all still\n(Still, still, still)\n\n[Verse 2]\nThey talk about the grind but I'm broke, I'm grindin'\nEvery dollar spent, now the people still whinin'\nBut I keep my head high, never fold, never lyin'\nAnd my heart's still cold even when the day's lyin'\nOne road left but I can't ride that chain\nI'ma keep it movin', yeah they all feel my pain\nThey say money talks, but I'm answerin' it's still\nSo I made it in silence, now I'm free from the deal\n\n[Chorus]\nTell me, why they hate when you live?\nGot the heart of a king, but the soul in the bills\nTell me, who the heck do they feel?\nWhen the world keep spinnin' but you lost it all still\n(Still, still, still)\nWhy they hate when you live?\nWith the heart of a king, but the soul in the bills\nTell me, who the heck do they feel?\nWhen the world keep spinnin' but you lost it all still\n(Still, still, still)\nWhy they hate when you live?\nWith the heart of a king, but the soul in the bills\nTell me, who the heck do they feel?\nWhen the world keep spinnin' but you lost it all still\n(Still, still, still)\n\n[Outro]\nThey can't cage the vibe, yeah\nYou gotta stay in\nIt's money and power, a universe, one rule\nMoney is the money\nAnd I'm not at the bottom\n[Instrumental fades out]",
