    "caption": "A smooth, contemporary R&B track built on a foundation of clean, chorused electric guitar chords and a steady, unobtrusive drum machine beat. A round synth bass provides a warm low end. The lead male vocal is clear and emotive, delivered in a smooth tenor with occasional falsetto ad-libs and layered harmonies that swell during the anthemic chorus. The arrangement features a brief, intimate bridge with whispered vocals before transitioning into a melodic guitar-led instrumental break. The track concludes with a layered vocal outro, combining sung melodies with whispered phrases that fade to a clean finish.",
    "lyrics": "[Intro]\nYeah\nOh\nYeah\n\n[Verse 1]\nMidnight whispers in my ear\nStars above, they're shining clear\nCity lights, they start to fade\nUnderneath, our plans we've made\nMoonlit shadows twist and turn\nHearts on fire, passions burn\nLaughter echoes through the night\nHolding hands, we take flight\n\n[Chorus]\nYou're my heartbeat symphony\nEchoes of sweet destiny\nEvery beat a symphony\nYou and me, we're wild and free\n\n[Verse 2]\nNeon dreams and city haze\nLost in love's enchanting maze\nWhisper secrets in the breeze\nTime just stops as we appease\n\n[Chorus]\nYou're my heartbeat symphony\nEchoes of sweet destiny\nEvery beat a symphony\nYou and me, we're wild and free\n\n[Bridge]\nDance through stars and find our way\nIn your arms, I'll always stay\nLove so strong, it never bends\nTogether 'til the journey ends\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Outro]\nDance through stars and find our way\nIn your arms, I'll always stay\nLove so strong, it never bends\nTogether 'til the journey ends\nYou're my heartbeat symphony\nEchoes of sweet destiny\nEvery beat a symphony\nYou and me, we're wild and free\nDance through stars and find our way\nIn your arms, I'll always stay\nLove so strong, it never bends\nTogether 'til the journey ends",
