    "caption": "A classic country-folk ballad driven by a steady acoustic guitar rhythm and a warm, earnest male vocal with a gentle twang. A simple bassline and a straightforward drum beat establish a heartfelt, mid-tempo groove. A plaintive harmonica weaves in and out, providing melodic fills and taking the lead during the instrumental breaks and the extended outro. The production is clean and direct, focusing on the storytelling and the sincere vocal performance, creating a nostalgic and romantic atmosphere.",
    "lyrics": "[Intro - Acoustic Guitar]\n\n[Verse 1]\nFound you standing in the river's roar\nHeartbeats racing like never before\nEyes met mine and time stood still\nDreams were spinning 'round this hill\nWalking barefoot on a dusty road\nFingers tracing where the pelo grow\nHear your laugh, it's a sweet melody\nLove a tune that sets me free\n\n[Chorus]\nI'll ride these heartstrings all night long\nSing our song where we belong\nIn the quiet moments where we're strong\nYour heartbeat's my favorite song\n\n[Instrumental Break - Harmonica Solo]\n\n[Verse 2]\nStars above us start to glow\nEvening whispers, soft and low\nUnderneath the moonlit sky\nWe're just two souls, you and I\nIn the silence, hearts will find their tune\nUnderneath the prairie moon\n\n[Instrumental Break - Acoustic Guitar]\n\n[Bridge]\nI'll ride those heartstrings 'til they stray\nWe'll find our way back someday\n\n[Chorus]\nI'll ride these heartstrings all night long\nSing our song where we belong\nIn the quiet moments where we're strong\nYour heartbeat's my favorite song\n\n[Outro - Harmonica and Guitar]\n[Final guitar strum]",
