    "caption": "A classic blues-rock arrangement with a soulful, nocturnal groove. The track is built on a tight rhythm section of a round-toned bass guitar and a crisp acoustic drum kit. A clean, slightly overdriven electric guitar provides bluesy licks and chordal stabs throughout the verses. The lead male vocal is smooth and soulful with a touch of rasp, soaring into layered harmonies during the expansive chorus. The song features a melodic and expressive guitar solo with classic bends and vibrato, followed by a breakdown and a final, stripped-down vocal section that fades into a concluding guitar flourish.",
    "lyrics": "[Intro - Guitar Riff]\n\n[Verse 1]\nCity lights, they dance for miles\nNeon dreams, they hum in style\nLate night tales in smoky bars\nWishing on these falling stars\n\n[Verse 2]\nFootsteps echo on the street\nMelodies in perfect beat\nLonely hearts with hidden scars\nStill we chase these falling stars\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, let's take this ride tonight\nThrough the shadows in the night\nFeel the rhythm of guitars\nLost in wishes, flying far\n\n[Verse 3]\nIn a world of glass and steel\nBroken dreams feel so unreal\nYet we sing beneath the stars\nWishing on these falling stars\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Bridge]\nBaselines thumping through the dark\nPianos playing in the park\nEvery note a shot of heart\nEvery whisper, falling stars\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, let's take this ride tonight\nThrough the shadows in the night\nFeel the rhythm of guitars\nLost in wishes, flying far\n\n[Outro]\nIn a world of glass and steel\nBroken dreams feel so unreal\nYet we sing beneath the stars\nWishing on these falling stars\n\n[Extended Guitar Solo and Outro]\n[Song fades out]",
